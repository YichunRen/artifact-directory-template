Title:
AutoLibrary - A Personal Digital Library to Find Related Works via Text Analyzer

Abstract:
When encountering scientific papers, it is challenging for readers themselves to find other related works. First of all, it is hard to identify keywords that summarize the papers to search for similar papers. This dilemma is most common if readers are not familiar with the domains of papers that they are reading. Meanwhile, traditional recommendation models based on user profile and collection data are not applicable for recommending similar works. Some existing digital librariesâ€™ recommender systems utilize phrase mining methods such as taxonomy construction and topic modeling, but such methods also fail to catch the specific topics of the paper. AutoLibrary is designed to address these difficulties, where users can input a scientific paper and get the most related papers. AutoLibrary solves the dilemma via a text analyzer method called AutoPhrase. AutoPhrase is a domain-independent phrase mining method developed by Jingbo Shang et al. (2018) that can automatically extract quality phrases from the input paper. After users upload the paper and select the fields of study of the paper, AutoLibrary utilizes AutoPhrase and our pre-trained domain datasets to return high-quality domain-specific keywords that could represent the paper. While AutoLibrary uses the top three keywords to search on Semantic Scholar for similar works at first, users could also customize the selection of the high-quality phrases or enter their own keywords to explore other related works. Based on the experiments and result analysis, AutoLibrary outperforms other similar text analyzer applications efficiently and effectively across different scientific fields. AutoLibrary is beneficial as it eases the pain point of manually extracting accurate, specific keywords from papers and provides a personalized user experience for finding related papers of various domains and subdomains.
